You should be able to run the run.bst file, it will take a while to run as it 
downloads a bunch of modules to run the script.

when ready to run it will ask for a series of comma separated words. 

It maps these words to a high dimensional vector space. 

To plot this, it is mapped down into a 3d space. So ti is best at displaying 3ish concepts, 
but feel free to try more.

It downloads about 3GB of stuff, the .venv folder is where it will be stored so if you want
to del it when not in use, the run.bat will redownload it.
